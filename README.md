### Project Description
💻 What is HVH?
HVH is the world's most uselessly brilliant website — a chaotic parody of scammy AIs, shady popups, and digital nonsense.

It fakes:

Virus alerts 🦠

Random loud audio 💥

Fake AI tests with Malayalam pazhamchollukal 🤯

Sketchy payment prompts (₹9999/month for nothing) 💸

Basically, if it confuses you — we did it right.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Websites today are too helpful. Where’s the confusion? The scams? The digital drama?
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing HVH:

CSS popups that scream “YOU'VE BEEN HACKED!”

JS that plays music randomly (you’ll jump)

Fake AI that tells you your fate using proverbs

Redirects to nonsense websites

Popups that beg for your location like your toxic ex

All for no reason. You’re welcome.
## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
🔧 Tech Stack
HTML – for the skeleton of chaos

CSS – for glowing error boxes & retina pain
